        "\n",
        "* **Key Difference:** The primary difference is the substitution of the NIR band with a **SWIR band** in MNDWI.\n",
        "* **Why SWIR?** Water absorbs SWIR radiation even more strongly than NIR radiation. Soil, vegetation, and especially built-up land features tend to have higher reflectance in the SWIR region compared to water.\n",
        "* **Advantages of MNDWI:**\n",
        "    * **Enhanced Water Feature Extraction:** MNDWI often provides better discrimination of water bodies from other features, especially in areas where NDWI might struggle.\n",
        "    * **Reduced Noise from Built-up Areas:** Built-up land and artificial structures can sometimes have NIR reflectance similar to water (or cause mixed pixel effects), leading to their misclassification as water by NDWI. These features generally have higher SWIR reflectance than water, so MNDWI can suppress signals from built-up areas more effectively, resulting in cleaner water masks.\n",
        "    * **Improved Performance with Turbid Water:** While both indices work for clear water, MNDWI can sometimes offer better delineation of turbid water.\n",

        "### **When to Use MNDWI:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* In **urban areas**, where built-up surfaces reflect NIR similar to water, causing NDWI to confuse water with man-made objects.\n",
        "* MNDWI uses **SWIR**, which is **highly absorbed by water** and **reflected by buildings**, improving discrimination.\n",
